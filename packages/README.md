Additional level of packages for multiple Studio projects use case.

- "common" package: to be deployed in the private marketplace and referenced by other projects in their application
  definition
- "vertical" package: same, although it could be the final application too
- "final1" and "final2": actual packages matching final applications (final2 also includes the vertical package,
  "final1" is supposed to have been initialized from it by copy instead)
